Bookstore App 📚

Welcome to the Bookstore App! This is a simple and stylish online bookstore where users can browse books, add them to their cart, and place orders. Built using modern web technologies, this app is fully responsive and user-friendly.

 What I've Used 🛠️

 Frontend 🌐
- React for building the user interface. It's super fast and flexible!
- Vite for blazing fast development.
- Tailwind CSS for creating a beautiful and responsive design with minimal effort.

Backend 🔙
- Node.js & Express for handling requests and creating a RESTful API.
- **MongoDB** for storing all the book, order, and user information securely.

Authentication 🔐
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication and authorization.

Deployment 🚀
- The frontend is hosted on **Vercel**.
- The backend is hosted on **Render**.
